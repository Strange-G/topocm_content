Zero-dimensional quantum systems (quantum dots)

 a quantum system with a finite number of states N. The Hamiltonian of such a system is 
 represented by a matrix H of dimension N×N. This matrix is Hermitian,
 H=H†<-(dagger).
 Its real eigenvalues En correspond to the allowed energies of the system,

   H|n>=Ei|n>,

with |n> the corresponding eigenstate.



Translation Symmetry
---------------------
Crystals posses this. Energy conservation is a consequense of
translation symettry in time.

Magnets exist because they spontaneously BREAK time-reversal
AND spin rotation symmetries?????


In topology, symmetry is like an added flavor => studying the same topologies
with different symetries provides completely different answers
