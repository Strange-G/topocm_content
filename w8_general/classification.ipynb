    "First of all, let's refresh the meaning of the different types of entries in the table. Each entry tells what is the topological classification of a system with a given combination of symmetries and dimensionality, that is the possible values that the topological invariant $Q$ of such a system can take.\n",
    "\n",
    "An empty entry means that the system cannot have a topological phase. In other words, all gapped Hamiltonians can be deformed into each other without closing the bulk gap, without breaking any existing symmetry.\n",
    "\n",
    "A $\\mathbb{Z}$ entry tells us that the topological invariant is an integer number, $Q=0, \\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\dots$ An example of such a system is the quantum Hall effect, whose topological invariant is the Chern number. The value of $Q$ specifies the number of chiral edge states and their chirality, opposite for opposite signs of $Q$.\n",
    "\n",
    "A $2\\mathbb{Z}$ entry is much like a $\\mathbb{Z}$ entry, except that the invariant may only take even numbers, $Q=0,\\pm2, \\pm4, \\dots$, because of some doubling of the degrees of freedom. An example is a quantum dot with a spinful time-reversal symmetry, whose topological invariant is the number of filled energy levels, and may only be even because of Kramers degeneracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "A $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ entry means that there are only two distinct topological phases, with $Q=\\pm 1$ (or $Q=0, 1$, depending on convenience). A known example is the Majorana chain with its Pfaffian invariant distinguish the two phases with or without unpaired end Majorana modes, and the time-reversal invariant topological insulators.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have attached a meaning to each singular entry of the table, let's try to understand the table as a whole. The first thing to do is to understand why it has ten and only ten rows."

    "Each row in the table corresponds to a certain *symmetry class*, that is to a given combination of the presence and absence of three fundamental discrete symmetries.\n",
    "\n",
    "You have already encountered these three symmetries all the way from week one. They are time-reversal symmetry ($\\mathcal{T}$), particle-hole symmetry ($\\mathcal{P}$) and chiral symmetry ($\\mathcal{C}$). We previously referred to chiral symmetry $\\mathcal{C}$ as sub-lattice symmetry because in condensed matter physics a natural realization of chiral symmetry happens when a system has two sublattices, and its Hamiltonian only connects sites in different sublattices.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why do we consider these symmetries fundamental, and restrict the periodic table only to these three?\n",
    "\n",
    "As you will recall from week one, and as Shinsei Ryu explained in the introductory video, normal unitary symmetries of a Hamiltonian do not lead to particularly interesting consequences on the topological classification. One may always make the Hamiltonian block-diagonal and reducing the problem to the study of a single block. This procedure can be iterated until one runs out of unitary symmetries and is left with an *irreducible* block of the Hamiltonian, one which cannot be further block-diagonalized.\n",
    "\n",
    "Time-reversal, particle-hole and chiral symmetry act in a different way. They impose certain constraints on an irreducible Hamiltonian - for instance, by forcing it to be a real matrix, or to be block off-diagonal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note, however, that it is possible to extend the periodic table to study the interplay between these three discrete symmetries and other unitary symmetries. For instance, we have already touched upon crystalline symmetries on week seven, and we will return to them in week ten.\n",
    "\n",
    "But for now, let's focus on $\\mathcal{P}$, $\\mathcal{T}$ and $\\mathcal{C}$. Let's recall the basic notions about them:\n",
    "\n",
    "* $\\mathcal{T}$ is an anti-unitary operator which commutes with the Hamiltonian.\n",
    "* $\\mathcal{P}$ is an anti-unitary operator which anti-commutes with the Hamiltonian.\n",
    "* $\\mathcal{C}$ is a unitary operator which anti-commutes with the Hamiltonian.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next important thing to know is that time-reversal and particle-hole symmetry may come in two separate flavors, depending on whether they square to plus or minus one.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, you will remember that for the time-reversal operator acting on electronic states, $\\mathcal{T}^2=-1$. This was the crux of Kramers theorem, which in turn was the key to topological insulators. If you go back to week one, you will also remember that we discussed real matrices, which were symmetric under a time-reversal operator $\\mathcal{T}=\\mathcal{K}$. This operator satisfies $\\mathcal{T}^2=1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, a system can behave in three ways under time-reversal symmetry $\\mathcal{T}$: (1) it does not have it, (2) it has it and it squares to $+1$, (3) it has it and it squares to $-1$. The same holds for particle-hole symmetry, which can also have $\\mathcal{P}^2=\\pm 1$. On the other hand, the chiral symmetry only comes in one flavor, $\\mathcal{C}^2=1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "OK, but how do we arrive at ten symmetry classes? Let's count all possible cases carefully. By combining the three cases for $\\mathcal{P}$ and the three cases for $\\mathcal{T}$ we arrive at nine possible combinations. \n",
    "\n",
    "The important thing to notice now is that $\\mathcal{C}$ is not completely independent from $\\mathcal{T}$ and $\\mathcal{P}$. Whenever a system has both $\\mathcal{T}$ and $\\mathcal{P}$, we can always find a chiral symmetry $\\mathcal{C}=\\mathcal{P\\cdot T}$, and this operator can always be made to satisfy $\\mathcal{C}^2=1$ up to an overall phase.\n",
    "\n",
    "This also means that if we already know that a system has only one between $\\mathcal{T}$ and $\\mathcal{P}$, it cannot have a chiral symmetry $\\mathcal{C}$. In other words, any of the two out of the three symmetries implies the third.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, if both $\\mathcal{P}$ and $\\mathcal{T}$ are absent, then chiral symmetry may or may not be present. This gives us two distinct cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence, the way we understand how there are 10 symmetry classes is via the following addition:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$(3\\times 3 - 1) + 2 = 8 + 2 = 10\\,.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The first term in the sum corresponds to the eight cases where there is at least one anti-unitary symmetry: either $\\mathcal{P}$, or $\\mathcal{T}$, or both. These eight classes are called *real* because an anti-unitary symmetry always involves the complex conjugation operator. (This does not necessarily mean that the Hamiltonian is a real matrix, but it is a reminder that there is a constraint between its real and imaginary parts).\n",
    "\n",
    "The second term in the sum covers the two cases when there are no anti-unitary symmetries. These symmetry classes are called *complex*.\n",
